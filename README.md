# Homework 14 - MVC Tech Blog

## Project Description 
This was quite the project. This repo contains the code for a blog website (supposedly for tech but can be used for anything). The website will store user information and their posts on various pages, some will show all user posts and some will only show posts unique to the user. The user has the ability to make comments on posts and to update or delete posts they've previously written.
